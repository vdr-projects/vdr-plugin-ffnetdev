Description:
------------

The purpose of this plugin is to provide an "easy" way of connecting possible streaming clients 
to VDR by emulating a full featured DVB device over the network including OSD and TS streaming capabilities.

The FFnetDev Plugin creates two listening TCP ports:
1) a VNC server on default port 20001 that exports the OSD and accepts remote control keys from the keyboard(or whatever the VNC client uses).
2) a TS streaming server on default port 20002 that streams the MPEG2 data instead of decoding and rendering it.
   The streaming server registers as a "normal" Full Featured DVB device in VDR. Therefore offering playback capabilites including playback of
   recordings and "transfer mode".

Both built-in servers work independent from each other.
So you can just use the plugin for viewing the OSD on a remote machine for example.

Details:
--------

OSD (and text2skin)
-------------------
The OSD is transfered using the VNC protocol (aka VNC). See rfbproto.h for details.
Features supported:
-currently supported encodings: RAW, RRE, Hextile, CoRRE (CoRRE have a bug)
-colour-map and truecolor
-depths in truecolor mode: 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit

You can also use the text2skin plugin to get a nice skinned OSD. 
BUT BE AWARE that the code supports ONE BIG AREA only(method CanHandleAreas).
This limitation is due to the fact that the built-in VNC server also supports palette based (a.k.a. colour map) framebuffer via VNC. 
So if you want to use the text2skin plugin you have to change the desired skin to only use ONE 
<window> tag with the greatest bounding rectangle the skin wants to draw in. bpp should be set to 8 bits.
This is NOT going to change in future versions of the ffnetdev plugin.

TS streaming
------------
The PES packets are multiplexed into a TS by the plugins own very simple PES2TS remux code.
No PAT/PMT insertion is currently being done.
The two TS PIDs for Audio and Video PIDs have fixed values. So changing a channel does not result in a change
of the TS PIDs. (Video-PID: 99, Audio-PID: 100 [decimal])

Existing clients
----------------
-Dreambox 5620S (simple native client, it is NOT an enigma plugin!, supports OSD via VNC and TS-Streaming)
-Tuxbox VDRViewer(simple native client, it is NOT an enigma plugin!, supports OSD via VNC and TS-Streaming) 
-Any VNC client using RFB protocol version 3.3 or 3.5 (TightVNC, RealVNC, etc.) should work

Command line options
--------------------

  -t PORT, --tsport PORT      port number for sending TS to.
  -o PORT, --osdport PORT     listen on this port for OSD connect.
  -e	   		      enable remote control over OSD connection. 
  
Option "-e" registers a new remote control object causing VDR to start the learning procedure for this new remote control if you start
VDR and the ffnetdev plugin for the first time. If you want to control VDR over SVDRP you can simply leave out the "-e" option.

--------------
Prerequisites:
--------------
This plugin only works for VDR versions >=1.3.18.
It is currently being developed with VDR version 1.3.28.

Installation:
-------------

Install ffnetdev like any other plugin. In this example I assume that you have
changed to the folder where the VDR sourcecode is located, and that it is 
version 0.0.3 of the plugin you wish to install.
